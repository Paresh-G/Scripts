ðŸ§° Steps to Create Swap Memory
1. Choose swap size & ensure free disk space
Decide how much swap you need (e.g. 1â€“4â€¯GB is common). Check disk space using below command

df -h /

2. Allocate the swap file
Using fallocate (fast, preferred): using below command

sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

3. Secure the file
Restrict access so only root can use it: by below command

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

4. Set up as swap space by using below command

sudo mkswap /swapfile

5. Enable swap immediately by using below command

sudo swapon /swapfile

6. Check it's active: by using below command

swapon --show
free -h

7. Make it persistent across reboots
Add this line to /etc/fstab:

/swapfile none swap sw 0 0

OR You can append it via: below command

echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

8.Then optionally reload mounts: by using below command

sudo swapon -a
